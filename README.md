# FAT12

_My personal FAT12 Floppy FS :)_
- Main Code is in the **fat** package.
- All other files belong to my byte array manipulation library but some of them are necessary for this FAT code.

Currently working:
- Read and write files in master dir
- List files in master dir
- Delete files in master dir
- Generate disk images with various boot blocks
- Set Volume Label
- accurate Time/Date stamps on files

Currently not implemented:
- Subdirectories
- All other stuff that is not listed in the above section

License:
- None. Do with the code whatever you want.
